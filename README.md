# Arduino-based-dual-axis-sun-tracker
Made this as a hardware project at the end of the first year of B.Tech. This Arduino-based hardware setup can sense temperature, humidity, &amp; rainfall in addition to its major feature which is tracking solar energy.
All the codes were written in Arduino IDE
TinkerCad Circuit:
